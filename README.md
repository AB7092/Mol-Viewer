# Mol-Viewer by Adarsh Bhavnagariya

Allows users to upload SDF files of molecules, the user then names the molecule and then can select from the uploaded molecules to view them. 
There are only 4 elements currently hardcoded into the application (Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen), 
  so molecules that contain only these elements will work right now such as Water or Caffeine
  More elements can easily be added to the server.py file.

Further improvements to be made: 
  Allow the user to add elements on the server, 
  Improve the GUI so it looks better, 
  Add the ability to rotate the molecule
